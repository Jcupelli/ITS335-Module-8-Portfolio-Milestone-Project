            <p>One of my favorite pastimes is exploring new eateries with friends. However, given the current economic climate where inflation, "shrink-flation," and a general dip in quality are all too common, these outings are becoming increasingly rare. I completely understand that running a restaurant isn’t cheap. Securing quality ingredients and ensuring fair wages are costly but necessary, and I’m truly happy to see improvements in server compensation—they certainly deserve it! Nonetheless, given the financial implications, particularly in our area where a meal can run $50+ per person without drinks, it seems more prudent to cut back.</p>
        
            <p>So, I've turned to recreating recipes at home and inviting friends over to enjoy them. It’s definitely more labor-intensive, but incredibly rewarding. I’m all for taking on the cooking, as long as someone else takes care of the dishes! A recipe high on my list to try has been Birria Tacos and there is no time like the present to give it a go.</p>
            <p>Birria Tacos are crafted from birria — a savory stew originally from Jalisco, Mexico, traditionally made with goat meat, though beef and lamb are also popular alternatives. The meat is marinated in a delectable adobo of vinegar, dried chilies, garlic, herbs, and spices, then slow-cooked until it's fall-apart tender. Served with chopped onions, cilantro, and a side of the spicy consomé for dipping, these tacos promise a burst of flavor and texture. The shredded meat is then tucked into corn tortillas, which are dipped in the rich fat rendered during cooking and crisped up on the grill. Served with chopped onions, cilantro, and a side of the spicy consomé for dipping, these tacos promise a burst of flavor and texture. Without further ado, let’s jump into it. As stated above this recipe that we are following is from House of Yumm by Serene.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Large Dutch oven</li>
                <li>Dried guajillos</li>
                <li>Cast iron skillet</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <p><strong>Short Ribs (Bone-in):</strong> This can be substituted for any cut with bones such as oxtails or simply beef bone. We need the bone for the broth. This is what is going to give us that nice thick texture to the broth/consomme.</p>
            <p><strong>Chuck Roast:</strong> Any large roast will work, chuck roast is a budget-friendly cut that provides a lot of meat. Since we’re cooking the meat low and slow, the roast has time to break down and become tender. You can substitute with goat or lamb meat if desired.</p>
            <p><strong>Guajillo Peppers:</strong> (2500-5000 SHU) these are a very common chile used in Mexican cooking. Adjust the chile used if needed; these are very mild and give color and flavoring to the broth. If you want heat, you can add in a Chile de Arbol if desired. My preference is to start with the guajillo peppers and then add in chili powder as needed for flavor and coloring as the soup cooks. These are dried chile peppers that can be found in the spice or Mexican aisles at most markets.</p>
            <p><strong>Carrots:</strong> This is a unique ingredient not in most recipes for birria. Adding the carrots gives a bit of sweetness and color to the broth and just adds to the flavoring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Instant Pot & Slow Cooker</h2>
            <p>If using a slow cooker or instant pot method for this recipe you will need to prepare the chile sauce separately and add it in for cooking. To make the sauce, add the chiles, onion, garlic, and carrots to a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and let simmer until they have all softened. Then blend using a small amount of water as needed to create a smooth consistency. Strain the sauce as needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Instant Pot Instructions:</strong> Sear the beef in the instant pot using the sauté setting. Then add the chile sauce, spices, and cover with enough water for cooking. Cook on High Pressure for 45 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes then quick release any remaining pressure. Continue with instructions on preparing the birria tacos.</p>
            <p><strong>Slow Cooker Instructions:</strong> If desired, sear the beef in a skillet on the stovetop and add to the slow cooker. Pour in the chile sauce, add the spices and seasonings, then cover with enough water for cooking. Cook on low for 8 hours. Then continue with the instructions on preparing the birria tacos.</p>

            <h2>Tips!</h2>
            <p><strong>Grab a very large pot!</strong> This recipe fills up my 7 qt Dutch oven to the very top. Prepare the ingredients, halve the onion, slice the carrots, cut the tip off the garlic bulb, cut off the stem of peppers and remove seeds.</p>
            <p><strong>Simmer:</strong> Add meat, onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaves and dried peppers to the pot then add enough water to cover all the ingredients. Add chicken bouillon, oregano, cumin, and salt, stir to combine. Bring this to a boil, then reduce heat and allow to simmer for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Skim:</strong> After 30 minutes of simmering, skim the top of the broth to remove any impurities that have come out of the bones from simmering. It will look like little bits of foam on the top of the broth.</p>
            <p><strong>Blend Peppers:</strong> Remove the peppers from the broth; they will be softened. Add them along with the carrots, onion, and garlic to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth. Add a small amount of broth if needed to get a nice smooth texture. Strain the peppers if needed to remove bits of skin (if using a high-powered blender this step is not necessary). Add in the chili powder as desired for flavor and to get a nice deep red color to the broth.</p>
            <p><strong>Simmer:</strong> Continue to let the stew simmer until the meat is tender and easily shreds. This takes about 3 hours or longer. Remove the lid and stir every 40 minutes or so. Taste the broth and adjust seasonings as needed during the cooking process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Storing:</strong> Store leftover birria and consommé in sealed containers in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. It’s best to store the meat and broth, then prepare the tacos when ready to serve. If you have leftover birria tacos, those can be stored for 1-2 days. Reheat leftover tacos in a skillet until the tortilla crisps back up.</p>
            <p><strong>Freezing:</strong> Allow the birria to cool completely then transfer to a freezer-safe container. Store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
            <p><strong>Reheating:</strong> Birria and consommé can be reheated on the stovetop over medium heat until warmed through.</p>
            <p><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Prepare the birria as directed. Shred the meat and store in the refrigerator. As the broth cools, the fat will form a solid layer on the top of the broth which makes it easier to separate. Spoon the fat off the top before reheating on the stovetop. Then prepare the tacos when ready to serve.</p>

                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine Ingredients: In a large pot, add meat, onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaves and dried peppers. Cover with water. (This uses my large 7 qt pot and fills it to the top!)</li>
                    <li>Add Seasonings: Add chicken bouillon, oregano, cumin and salt, stir to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Skim: After 30 minutes, skim the top of the pot to remove impurities from the bone cooking out. (Will look like little bits of foam on the top)</li>
                    <li>Blend Peppers: Remove the peppers (should be softened), onion, garlic (squeeze the cloves out of the bulb) and carrots and place in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, add up to 1/4 cup of broth if needed to help get a smooth consistency.</li>
                    <li>Strain: Strain the peppers if needed to remove bits of skin (if using a high-powered blender this step is not necessary).</li>
                    <li>Combine: Add the blended peppers into the broth and stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Season: Add in the chili powder as desired to get a nice deep red color to the broth.</li>
                    <li>Simmer: Cover and continue to simmer for about 3 hours or until meat is tender and easily shredding on its own. (Remove lid and give a stir every 40 minutes or so. Can also taste the broth once the meat is cooked through and adjust seasonings as needed).</li>
                    <li>Reserve Grease: Skim the grease from the top of the broth (SAVE THIS!) pour the grease into a small skillet or saucepan, this is used for making the tacos if desired.</li>
                    <li>Serving: Remove the meat from the broth and cut into large chunks for serving. Remove any bones.</li>
                    <li>To Serve As A Stew: Serve a couple pieces of meat into a bowl, spoon broth on top. Top with diced onion and fresh cilantro. Serve with a wedge of lime to squeeze in.</li>
                    <li>To Make Queso Birria Tacos: Chop Meat: Remove the meat from the broth, and finely chop until only small pieces remain. Heat a large skillet/griddle over medium heat. Frying Tortillas: Dip the corn tortilla into the reserved grease from the broth. Place on heated griddle, top with the chopped meat and cheese. Fold the taco over and press down with a spatula. Continue cooking until the taco is crisp and golden on the bottom, about 2-3 minutes. Then flip and continue cooking the other side. (It’s ok if some of the cheese leaks out while frying, the golden cheese is the best part!) Plus you can spoon some additional grease onto the tortilla while it cooks if you need more coloring to the tortilla. Cook until both sides are crisp. Remove from heat and allow to cool briefly before serving, will be very hot. Continue until all tacos are cooked. Top tacos with fresh cilantro and onion if desired. Serving: Serve with a bowl of the broth topped with onions and cilantro on the side. Dip the tacos into the broth while eating.</li>
